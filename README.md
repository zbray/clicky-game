# Clicky Game
Clicky Game - First React App

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a memory game with the logic that can keep track of players' clicks and randomize different elements on a page. This project will be built using React components.

## Usage

This project presents the user with a series of images and instructs them to click every image only once. On launch the images are placed randomly on the screen. The images are randomly assorted again after an image is clicked, making this memory game a little difficult.

When the player clicks on an image they have not previously clicked on, their score goes up by one. As the user continues to click on different images, this score will increase. If the user successfully clicks on all the different images once, they win and their High Score matches 12. If before they reach 12 they click on an image they've already clicked on, it'll be game over for that round and their High Score will match the number of images they're clicked on that were different.
